## What are some differences between class and functional components?

> Class components are ES6 classes that can have state and lifecycle methods, such as `componentDidMount`. It requires the use of `this` keyword to access props and state.
>
> Functional components are functions that take in props and return JSX. They do not have state or lifecycle methods. They instead use hooks to manage state and lifecycle.

## Explain what lifecycle is in a simple way. 

> A lifecycle method is a method that is called at a specific point in the component's life. For example, `componentDidMount` is called after the component is rendered for the first time. The React component lifecycle consists of three phases: mounting, updating, and unmounting.

## How do you manage it in class and functional components?

> Hooks are used to manage lifecycle in functional components. For example, `useEffect` is used to manage side effects in functional components.

## Explain immutability in one sentence.

> Immutable objects are objects whose state cannot be modified after they are created.
